with Min Conflicts Heuristic, that chooses a greedy move in every step, based on variable conflicts number.

# How to Use

Program is divided in two parts: Map Coloring files and n-Queens files. In every directory there are 3 type of python file, \
one that contains function and classes used, one contains tests (that produce also graphics) and a demo file with we
can try examples and visualize them (thanks to graphic functions).
